## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### âœ… Task 1: Calculator  
A simple arithmetic calculator using C++'s `switch` statement.  
**Concepts Used:** Conditionals, Arithmetic Operations, User Input  
ðŸ“„ `calculator.cpp`

---

### âœ… Task 2: Tic Tac Toe Game  
A terminal-based 2-player Tic Tac Toe game.  
**Concepts Used:** 2D Vectors, Game Logic, Input Validation  
ðŸ“„ `tic_tac_toe.cpp`

---

### âœ… Task 3: To-Do List Manager  
Command-line to-do app for adding, completing, viewing, and deleting tasks.  
**Concepts Used:** Vectors, Structs, Basic CRUD Operations  
ðŸ“„ `todo_list.cpp`

---

### âœ… Task 4: Image Processing with OpenCV  
Applies grayscale, blur, sharpen, crop, resize, brightness/contrast, and save functions to images using OpenCV.  
**Concepts Used:** OpenCV, Mat operations, Filters  
ðŸ“„ `image_editor.cpp`  
ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Requires OpenCV installed and a valid image path.

---

### âœ… Task 5: Number Guessing Game  
A fun terminal-based game where you guess a number between 1 and 100.  
**Concepts Used:** Loops, Random Number Generation, Conditionals  
ðŸ“„ `guess_game.cpp`

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. **Compile the Code**  
   Use any standard C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, MSVC):
   ```bash
   g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
   ./calculator
   ```

2. **Run OpenCV Projects**  
   Ensure OpenCV is properly linked:
   ```bash
   g++ image_editor.cpp -o editor `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
   ./editor
   ```

3. **Use an IDE (optional)**  
   These projects can be run in:
   - VS Code
   - Code::Blocks
   - Turbo C++
   - CLion
